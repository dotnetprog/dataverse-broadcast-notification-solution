## Getting Started
 
### 1. Import Solution
1. Simply download the latest [release](https://github.com/dotnetprog/dataverse-broadcast-notification-solution/releases/latest)

2. Import the Managed or Unmanaged solution to your dataverse environment

### 2. Setup security roles

The solution provides two security roles:
- App Global Notification - Manager
  - Allow users to create/edit/delete global notifications
  - Allow acces to the model-driven app: *AppNotification Broadcasts Management*
- App Global Notification - Reader
  - This role gives only the read privilege to global notifications, required to display notifications
  - Does not give access to the model-driven app: *AppNotification Broadcasts Management*

If you want to use your own security roles:

- Make sure your end-users have atleast **read organization level privilege** on the following entities:
  - fdn_BroadcastAppNotification
  - fdn_LocalizedNotificationContent
- Make sure your admin users have atleast **create,write and read organization level privileges** on the following entities:
  - fdn_BroadcastAppNotification
  - fdn_LocalizedNotificationContent

### 3. Configure your global notifications

1. Navigate to the model-driven app: *AppNotification Broadcasts Management* 
2. Create a new global notification \

> **Note :** Notifications must be published to be visible by your end users.

## Important ‚ùó What you need to know ‚ùó

- Notifications can take up to **5 minutes** to be visible by your end-users. For performance purposes, the query result is cached for 5 minutes until it queries again.
  - Currently, the cache time is hardcoded. This will be configurable in a futur release.
- Notifications are displayed when user:
  - loads a form record
  - loads a 'entitylist' page
- Only Notifications that are bound the current model driven app that the end user is on will show up.
- Only **Published** notifications are displayed.
- Notifications can be unpublished the same way you publish them.
- As of now, users are not able to 'dissmiss' notifications as there was no supported way to save that state.
- The global notifications works around the [Xrm.App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference/xrm-app) Client-Api
- The notification mechanism uses the application ribbon to display the notifications. There is a hidden button with a custom enable rule that it's sole purpose is to render the notifications to the ui.
